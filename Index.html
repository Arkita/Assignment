          <h2>Vegetarian</h2>
          <p>On average, people who follow vegetarian diets weigh less and have and lower risks for heart disease
             and some kinds of cancer. These potential benefits are more likely when you make nutritious choices,
              such as choosing nutrient-dense foods, including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes and healthy fats.
               Also, limit your intake of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, high-sodium foods and foods high in saturated 
               fat. Keeping a list of healthy vegetarian foods handy can guide your meal planning so that you always have
                healthy and interesting options on hand. </p>

          <h2>Non-Vegetarian</h2>
          <p>Meat is good for our body as it is the most important source of proteins , vitamin’s E and B and Zinc, but we must know the kind of meat we should consume. 
In a layman’s term, most of the meat which is red in color is also full of unwanted cholesterol and saturated fat and the white meats are usually much leaner. 
Boneless chicken and turkey are the leanest meats and should be consumed often for major health benefits. Whereas if you are a fan of red meats, the best way to cut down on the cholesterol is by either cutting away the fat portions from the meat or draining the extra fat while cooking. 
Instead of eating, lamb, pork and beef often, one should substitute it with leaner meats as often as possible. </p>
